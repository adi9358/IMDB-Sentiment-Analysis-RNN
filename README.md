<h1>IMDB Sentiment Analysis using Simple RNN </h1>
This project is a basic implementation of sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset using a Simple RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model. 
The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative based on their content.
A user-friendly Streamlit web app is also included for easy interaction with the model.


<h2>ðŸš€ Features</h2>
.Binary sentiment classification (Positive / Negative)
.Built with TensorFlow and Keras
.Simple RNN architecture
.Clean and intuitive Streamlit interface for real-time predictions

<h2>ðŸ“Š Dataset</h2>
The model uses the IMDB dataset provided by Keras, which contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.
The dataset is preprocessed (tokenized and padded) before being fed into the model.
 
<h2>Model Architecture</h2>
.Embedding Layer
.SimpleRNN Layer
.Dense Output Layer with Sigmoid Activation
